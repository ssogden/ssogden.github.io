[![Will 10 Gigabit work with Cat5e? - 10Gbe HomeLab Network Upgrade!](https://img.youtube.com/vi/_HaLU3ecUSY/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HaLU3ecUSY "Will 10 Gigabit work with Cat5e? - 10Gbe HomeLab Network Upgrade!")

After deciding to upgrade my "old" 24 PoE switch to a new 48 port PoE switch with 4 SFP+ ports, I decided to check to see if my old house with old Cat5e network wiring will work at 10 gigabit speeds!  If this works, I will have a 10 Gbe network connection from my PCs to my HomeLab server rack!
